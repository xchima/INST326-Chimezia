//Week 1: The last time I used Ai was when I was asking about allergy shots and its effectiveness because I am allergic to dog and I was trying to see if allergy shots would help me.
//Week 2: This week I used AI to recommend me a song to use for a class assignment.
//Week 3: This week I asked AI to help me on my job resume, safe to say theres still some problems.
//Week 4: This week I asked AI about how to get a personalized license plate, apparently in MD it's a lot of steps for it.
